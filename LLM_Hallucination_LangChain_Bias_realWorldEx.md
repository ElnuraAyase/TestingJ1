## üîπ Section 1: What Is LangChain?

LangChain is a **framework** that allows developers to build **reliable, context-aware LLM applications**. It connects language models (like GPT, Claude, Mistral) with tools, APIs, knowledge sources, and memory to:

* Reduce hallucinations
* Improve factuality
* Control structure
* Support retrieval and validation

Certainly ‚Äî here‚Äôs a clear and structured **list of bias examples in LLMs**, categorized by type, with real or typical prompts and outputs.

You can plug this into your manual under the section:

> **üß† What is Bias?**

Bias in LLMs refers to the tendency of the model to produce outputs that are unfair, unbalanced, or stereotypical, often due to imbalances or prejudices present in the data it was trained on.

### ‚úÖ **Why This Matters in Testing and Applications**

* These biases can lead to **exclusion, offense, or misinformation** in real-world applications.
* Bias can affect user trust, especially in **education, HR, healthcare, legal, or public-facing** systems.
* QA teams must test prompts across **diverse demographics and use cases** to detect these hidden patterns.

## üîπ Section 8: Final Guidance

### ‚úÖ For Developers and Testers:

* Use LangChain for **tool chaining, retrieval grounding, and output validation**
* Add **prompt observability and logging**
* Treat LLM QA like software QA: write **unit tests**, **bias tests**, and **risk tests**

### ‚úÖ For Business Stakeholders:

* LangChain **reduces hallucination and legal risk** when paired with verified knowledge
* Alternatives exist, but LangChain remains **one of the most developer-ready and enterprise-adopted** frameworks
* Make decisions based on **data sensitivity**, **deployment needs**, and **governance frameworks**
