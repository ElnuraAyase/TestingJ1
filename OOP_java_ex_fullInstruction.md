You're very welcome! 😊 Let's turn this into a **comprehensive, well-explained OOP guide** — perfect for both **learning** and **reviewing** the concepts.

# 📚 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Complete Guide with Examples

---

## 🔷 What is OOP?

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects,” which are instances of **classes**. Objects represent **real-world entities** and contain:

- **Attributes (fields/variables)** – describe the object
- **Methods (functions)** – define the object’s behavior

---

## ✅ **4 Main Principles of OOP**

1. **Encapsulation** – Binding data and methods together, and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
2. **Abstraction** – Hiding unnecessary implementation details and exposing only relevant functionalities.
3. **Inheritance** – Mechanism by which one class can inherit fields and methods from another class.
4. **Polymorphism** – Ability to take many forms; using the same method name but different behavior depending on the object.

# 🧮 EXAMPLE PROJECT: Calculator App (Java)

---

## 🔒 1. ENCAPSULATION

### 📘 Explanation:
Encapsulation means **hiding internal data** and **only allowing controlled access** through public methods. It keeps your data safe and prevents bugs from accidental changes.

---

### ✅ Example 1: Secure memory in calculator

```java
public class Calculator {
    private double memory; // Internal state is hidden

    public void store(double value) {  // Controlled access
        memory = value;
    }

    public double recall() {  // Safe access
        return memory;
    }
}
```

### ❌ Without Encapsulation:

```java
public class Calculator {
    public double memory;  // Direct access – unsafe
}

Calculator calc = new Calculator();
calc.memory = -9999;  // Anyone can mess with memory!
```

**🔄 Effect:** Without encapsulation, it's easier to break the app accidentally.

---

### ✅ Example 2: Restrict result access

```java
public class Calculator {
    private double result;  // Result is hidden

    public double add(double a, double b) {
        result = a + b;
        return result;
    }

    public double getResult() {
        return result;  // Only read access
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Example 3: Input validation through setters

```java
public class Calculator {
    private int precision;

    public void setPrecision(int p) {
        if (p >= 0) {
            precision = p;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid precision!");
        }
    }

    public int getPrecision() {
        return precision;
    }
}
```

---

## 🧊 2. ABSTRACTION

### 📘 Explanation:
Abstraction focuses on **what an object does**, not **how it does it**. It hides internal logic and exposes only the essential parts through interfaces or abstract classes.

---

### ✅ Example 1: Abstract class for calculator operations

```java
abstract class Operation {
    public abstract double execute(double a, double b);  // Only behavior exposed
}
```

---

### ✅ Example 2: Implement different operations

```java
class Addition extends Operation {
    public double execute(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;  // Specific implementation
    }
}

class Subtraction extends Operation {
    public double execute(double a, double b) {
        return a - b;
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Example 3: Calculator only uses the interface

```java
public class CalculatorApp {
    public static double calculate(Operation op, double a, double b) {
        return op.execute(a, b);  // Doesn’t care if it's add or subtract
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(calculate(new Addition(), 5, 3));  // Output: 8
    }
}
```

---

## 🧬 3. INHERITANCE

### 📘 Explanation:
Inheritance allows a class (child) to **reuse code from another class** (parent). This supports reusability and logical hierarchy.

---

### ✅ Example 1: Extend operations

```java
class Operation {
    public String describe() {
        return "Performs a calculation";
    }
}

class Multiply extends Operation {
    public double execute(double a, double b) {
        return a * b;  // Extends base behavior
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Example 2: Extend calculator types

```java
class BasicCalculator {
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

class ScientificCalculator extends BasicCalculator {
    public double power(double a, double b) {
        return Math.pow(a, b);  // Adds new feature
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Example 3: Add logging via override

```java
class LoggingCalculator extends BasicCalculator {
    @Override
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        double result = super.add(a, b);  // Reuse parent method
        System.out.println("Logged: " + a + " + " + b + " = " + result);
        return result;
    }
}
```

---

## 🔁 4. POLYMORPHISM

### 📘 Explanation:
Polymorphism lets you use **one method or class name** with **different behavior** depending on the object type. It allows flexibility and cleaner code.

---

### ✅ Example 1: Shared interface, different results

```java
class Division extends Operation {
    public double execute(double a, double b) {
        return b == 0 ? Double.NaN : a / b;
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Example 2: Loop through operations

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Operation[] ops = {
            new Addition(), new Subtraction(), new Division()
        };

        for (Operation op : ops) {
            System.out.println(op.execute(10, 5));  // Different behavior, same method
        }
    }
}
```

---

### ✅ Example 3: Override in child class

```java
class FancyCalculator extends BasicCalculator {
    @Override
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return super.add(a, b) + 0.001;  // Custom result
    }
}
```

### ✅ 🏪 E-commerce App: Product Abstraction

```java
abstract class Product {
    public abstract double getPrice();
}

class Book extends Product {
    public double getPrice() {
        return 12.99;
    }
}

class Electronics extends Product {
    public double getPrice() {
        return 199.99;
    }
}
```

➡️ *Use same method (`getPrice`) for different product types.*

### ✅ 🎮 Game App: Character Inheritance and Polymorphism

```java
class Character {
    public void attack() {
        System.out.println("Character attacks");
    }
}

class Warrior extends Character {
    @Override
    public void attack() {
        System.out.println("Warrior slashes!");
    }
}

class Mage extends Character {
    @Override
    public void attack() {
        System.out.println("Mage casts spell!");
    }
}
```
