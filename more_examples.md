# üßÆ OOP Principles Explained with Calculator App (Java)

## üî∑ What is OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" ‚Äî instances of classes ‚Äî to organize software design. Instead of focusing on functions and logic, OOP centers around data (attributes) and methods (functions or procedures) that act on that data. The main benefit of OOP is that it enables easier organization, modification, and scaling of code by promoting reusability, flexibility, and modularity.

The key principles of OOP are:

1. **Encapsulation** ‚Äì Hiding internal states and requiring all interactions to be performed through methods.
2. **Abstraction** ‚Äì Hiding complex details and showing only the necessary parts.
3. **Inheritance** ‚Äì Allowing new classes to take on the properties of existing ones.
4. **Polymorphism** ‚Äì Enabling objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through shared interfaces.

---

## üîê 1. ENCAPSULATION

### üìò Explanation:
Encapsulation is the principle of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class. It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of preventing unintended interference with the internal workings of an object.

---

### ‚úÖ WITH ENCAPSULATION (Calculator App)

#### Example 1: Secure memory
```java
public class Calculator {
    private double memory; // Internal state is hidden from the outside, ensuring no direct access

    // Method to store a value in memory, which controls how memory is updated
    public void store(double value) {
        memory = value;  // Memory can only be updated using this method
    }

    // Method to retrieve the value from memory, providing read-only access
    public double recall() {
        return memory;  // Memory can only be accessed, not modified directly
    }
}
```

#### ‚ùå WITHOUT ENCAPSULATION - Example 1
```java
public class Calculator {
    public double memory;  // Direct access to memory, no restrictions or control
}

// Example of unsafe use:
Calculator c = new Calculator();
c.memory = -10000;  // The internal memory state can be directly modified, leading to potential issues
```

---

#### Example 2: Safe result access
```java
public class Calculator {
    private double result;  // Result is hidden from outside, ensuring controlled access

    // Method to perform an addition operation and store the result
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        result = a + b;  // The result of the addition is stored safely
        return result;  // The result is returned to the caller
    }

    // Getter method to safely access the result (read-only)
    public double getResult() {
        return result;  // Access to the result is controlled and read-only
    }
}
```

#### ‚ùå WITHOUT ENCAPSULATION - Example 2
```java
public class Calculator {
    public double result;  // Direct access to result, can be changed without any checks
}

// Example of unsafe access:
Calculator c = new Calculator();
c.result = 1000;  // Result can be directly changed without any control over its value
```

---

#### Example 3: Input validation
```java
public class Calculator {
    private int precision;  // Precision value is hidden, access is controlled

    // Method to set the precision, with validation to ensure it is a positive number
    public void setPrecision(int p) {
        if (p >= 0) {
            precision = p;  // Only allow valid (non-negative) precision values
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid precision!");  // Print error if precision is negative
        }
    }

    // Getter method to retrieve the current precision value (read-only)
    public int getPrecision() {
        return precision;  // Provides controlled access to the precision value
    }
}
```

#### ‚ùå WITHOUT ENCAPSULATION - Example 3
```java
public class Calculator {
    public int precision;  // Direct access to precision, no validation on values
}

// Example of unsafe use:
Calculator c = new Calculator();
c.precision = -5;  // Precision can be set to any value, even negative, causing potential errors
```

‚û°Ô∏è **Effect:** Without encapsulation, any part of the code can change internal values directly, which may lead to bugs, inconsistent states, or unpredictable behavior. Encapsulation prevents this by restricting how internal states are accessed and modified.

---

## üßä 2. ABSTRACTION

### üìò Explanation:
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the internal workings of a system and exposing only the necessary parts to the user. It allows the user to interact with an object or system through a simplified interface, without needing to understand its internal implementation.

---

### ‚úÖ WITH ABSTRACTION (Calculator App)

#### Example 1: Abstract class for calculator operations
```java
// Abstract class representing a generic operation
abstract class Operation {
    public abstract double execute(double a, double b);  // The behavior is defined, but implementation is deferred to subclasses
}
```

#### ‚ùå WITHOUT ABSTRACTION - Example 1
```java
// Without abstraction, the calculator would have no structure to handle operations
public class Calculator {
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;  // Direct implementation without abstraction
    }

    public double subtract(double a, double b) {
        return a - b;  // Direct implementation without abstraction
    }
}
```

---

#### Example 2: Implementing different operations
```java
class Addition extends Operation {
    @Override
    public double execute(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;  // Specific implementation for addition
    }
}

class Subtraction extends Operation {
    @Override
    public double execute(double a, double b) {
        return a - b;  // Specific implementation for subtraction
    }
}
```

#### ‚ùå WITHOUT ABSTRACTION - Example 2
```java
// Without abstraction, different operation types are not reusable
public class Calculator {
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;  // Direct addition implementation
    }

    public double subtract(double a, double b) {
        return a - b;  // Direct subtraction implementation
    }
}
```

---

#### Example 3: Calculator only uses the interface
```java
public class CalculatorApp {
    // Method that takes any operation and performs it, without needing to know the specific operation
    public static double calculate(Operation op, double a, double b) {
        return op.execute(a, b);  // Doesn't care if it's add or subtract, just executes the operation
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage of abstraction where the operation type is hidden
        System.out.println(calculate(new Addition(), 5, 3));  // Output: 8
    }
}
```

#### ‚ùå WITHOUT ABSTRACTION - Example 3
```java
// Without abstraction, the calculator would have to know about specific operations
public class CalculatorApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage without abstraction
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        System.out.println(calc.add(5, 3));  // Direct use of the add method
    }
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è **Effect:** Without abstraction, the system is less flexible and harder to extend. Every time a new operation is added, the entire system may need to be modified. Abstraction provides a clean and scalable way to add new functionality without affecting existing code.

---

## üß¨ 3. INHERITANCE

### üìò Explanation:
Inheritance allows a class (child) to reuse code from another class (parent). This supports reusability and logical hierarchy.

---

### ‚úÖ WITH INHERITANCE (Calculator App)

#### Example 1: Extend operations
```java
class Operation {
    public String describe() {
        return "Performs a calculation";  // Common behavior for all operations
    }
}

class Multiply extends Operation {
    @Override
    public double execute(double a, double b) {
        return a * b;  // Extends base behavior and implements the multiply operation
    }
}
```

#### ‚ùå WITHOUT INHERITANCE - Example 1
```java
// Without inheritance, each operation would need to define its own description
public class Multiply {
    public double execute(double a, double b) {
        return a * b;  // Direct implementation without extending a base operation class
    }

    public String describe() {
        return "Performs multiplication";  // Direct implementation of description
    }
}
```

---

#### Example 2: Extend calculator types
```java
class BasicCalculator {
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;  // Basic addition functionality
    }
}

class ScientificCalculator extends BasicCalculator {
    public double power(double a, double b) {
        return Math.pow(a, b);  // Adds power functionality to the scientific calculator
    }
}
```

#### ‚ùå WITHOUT INHERITANCE - Example 2
```java
// Without inheritance, there would be duplicate code for basic and scientific calculators
public class ScientificCalculator {
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;  // Repeated addition functionality
    }

    public double power(double a, double b) {
        return Math.pow(a, b);  // Scientific calculator functionality
    }
}
```

---

#### Example 3: Add logging via override
```java
class LoggingCalculator extends BasicCalculator {
    @Override
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        double result = super.add(a, b);  // Reuse parent method
        System.out.println("Logged: " + a + " + " + b + " = " + result);  // Log the operation
        return result;
    }
}
```

#### ‚ùå WITHOUT INHERITANCE - Example 3
```java
// Without inheritance, we would need to implement everything in one class
public class LoggingCalculator {
    public double add(double a, double b) {
        double result = a + b;
        System.out.println("Logged: " + a + " + " + b + " = " + result);  // Log the operation
        return result;
    }
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è **Effect:** Without inheritance, there is redundant code, and the system becomes harder to maintain. Inheritance allows you to build upon existing functionality, promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.

---

## üîÅ 4. POLYMORPHISM

### üìò Explanation:
Polymorphism allows you to use one method or class name with different behavior depending on the object type. It allows flexibility and cleaner code by enabling objects of different types to be treated as instances of the same class through a shared interface.

---

### ‚úÖ WITH POLYMORPHISM (Calculator App)

#### Example 1: Shared interface, different results
```java
class

 Division extends Operation {
    @Override
    public double execute(double a, double b) {
        return b == 0 ? Double.NaN : a / b;  // Different behavior based on input
    }
}
```

#### ‚ùå WITHOUT POLYMORPHISM - Example 1
```java
// Without polymorphism, each operation would need to be handled separately
public class CalculatorApp {
    public static double divide(double a, double b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return Double.NaN;  // Handle division by zero directly
        } else {
            return a / b;
        }
    }
}
```

Absolutely! Here's the **üß† BONUS** section, fully formatted in Markdown and styled consistently with the rest of the document, including **"with"** and **"without"** examples where applicable ‚Äî and your requested addition of the **overloading problem** and how **polymorphism** solves it.

### ‚úÖ üè™ E-commerce App: Product Abstraction

#### ‚úÖ WITH ABSTRACTION
```java
// Abstract class defining the structure for all products
abstract class Product {
    public abstract double getPrice();  // Only exposes essential behavior
}

class Book extends Product {
    @Override
    public double getPrice() {
        return 12.99;  // Specific logic for Book
    }
}

class Electronics extends Product {
    @Override
    public double getPrice() {
        return 199.99;  // Specific logic for Electronics
    }
}

// Example usage
public class Store {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Product p1 = new Book();
        Product p2 = new Electronics();

        System.out.println(p1.getPrice());  // Output: 12.99
        System.out.println(p2.getPrice());  // Output: 199.99
    }
}
```

#### ‚ùå WITHOUT ABSTRACTION
```java
// Each product has its own method, no shared abstraction
class Book {
    public double bookPrice() {
        return 12.99;
    }
}

class Electronics {
    public double electronicsPrice() {
        return 199.99;
    }
}

// Client must know product types and methods
public class Store {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Book book = new Book();
        Electronics elec = new Electronics();

        System.out.println(book.bookPrice());
        System.out.println(elec.electronicsPrice());
    }
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è **Effect:** Without abstraction, your code becomes tightly coupled to concrete classes, making it harder to extend or modify.

### ‚úÖ üéÆ Game App: Character Inheritance and Polymorphism

#### ‚úÖ WITH INHERITANCE + POLYMORPHISM
```java
class Character {
    public void attack() {
        System.out.println("Character attacks");
    }
}

class Warrior extends Character {
    @Override
    public void attack() {
        System.out.println("Warrior slashes!");
    }
}

class Mage extends Character {
    @Override
    public void attack() {
        System.out.println("Mage casts a spell!");
    }
}

// Unified interface in action
public class Game {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Character[] party = { new Warrior(), new Mage() };

        for (Character member : party) {
            member.attack();  // Calls the correct attack method automatically
        }
    }
}
```

#### ‚ùå WITHOUT INHERITANCE
```java
class Warrior {
    public void warriorAttack() {
        System.out.println("Warrior slashes!");
    }
}

class Mage {
    public void mageAttack() {
        System.out.println("Mage casts a spell!");
    }
}

// No shared interface or structure
public class Game {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Warrior w = new Warrior();
        Mage m = new Mage();

        w.warriorAttack();
        m.mageAttack();
    }
}
```

‚û°Ô∏è **Effect:** Without inheritance and polymorphism, every new character type requires additional logic, making the code less scalable and harder to maintain.

| **Polymorphism**   | Flexibility        | Treat objects generically                                | Too many if-else or switch cases                  |

### ‚úÖ **Summary**

- **Encapsulation**: Hide internal state with private attributes, access through getter/setter methods.
- **Abstraction**: Use abstract classes or interfaces to expose behavior while hiding implementation details.
- **Inheritance**: Share common logic using `extends` and override behavior in child classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Same method name behaves differently depending
