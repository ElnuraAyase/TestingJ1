### ‚úÖ True or False (Advanced)

| Statement | ‚úÖ True/False | Explanation |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| `git fetch` updates your working branch | ‚ùå False | `git fetch` downloads changes from the remote repository but does not update your working directory or local branches. You need to use `git merge` or `git rebase` to integrate the fetched changes into your working branch. |
| `git rebase` rewrites commit history | ‚úÖ True | `git rebase` changes the base of a branch by replaying its commits on top of another branch. It effectively rewrites the commit history, making it linear. |
| Git works offline | ‚úÖ True | Once you've cloned a repository, Git operates locally on your machine. You can commit, branch, and reset without needing an internet connection. However, you'll need internet access to fetch from or push to a remote repository. |
| `git stash pop` removes stash entry after restoring | ‚úÖ True | `git stash pop` restores changes from the most recent stash and then deletes it from the stash list. |
| `git revert` deletes history | ‚ùå False | `git revert` creates a new commit that undoes the changes made by a previous commit, but it doesn‚Äôt delete history. Instead, it adds a new commit that "reverts" the previous changes. |
| `.gitignore` ignores already tracked files | ‚ùå False | `.gitignore` only ignores untracked files. If a file is already being tracked by Git, you need to untrack it first (using `git rm --cached <file>`) for `.gitignore` to take effect. |
| `git push` creates commits | ‚ùå False | `git push` only uploads your local commits to the remote repository. It does not create any new commits. Commits are created by `git commit`. |
| Merge conflicts require manual fixes | ‚úÖ True | When Git cannot automatically merge changes due to conflicting modifications, it flags a merge conflict. You need to manually resolve these conflicts and then commit the result. |
| A fork is a repo you cloned from someone else | ‚úÖ True | A fork is a copy of someone else's repository that you can modify. It is typically used in open-source contributions, allowing you to push changes without affecting the original repository. |
| `git tag` is for marking commits | ‚úÖ True | `git tag` is used to mark specific commits, typically to signify releases or milestones in the project. |
| `git pull` = fetch + merge | ‚úÖ True | `git pull` is a combination of two commands: `git fetch`, which retrieves changes from the remote, and `git merge`, which integrates those changes into your current branch. |
| IntelliJ can handle merge conflicts via UI | ‚úÖ True | IntelliJ IDEA has built-in tools for resolving merge conflicts using a graphical interface, making it easier to review and fix conflicts. |
| `git reset --hard` is easily reversible | ‚ùå False | `git reset --hard` is not easily reversible. It discards both the commit and the changes in your working directory. Once executed, it cannot be undone without specific recovery tools. |
| Submodules must be cloned separately | ‚úÖ True | Submodules are separate Git repositories within your project. You need to clone them explicitly using `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`. |
| GitHub and Git are the same | ‚ùå False | GitHub is a platform for hosting Git repositories and collaborating on them. Git is a version control system that works locally and doesn‚Äôt require a hosting service. |
| `git cherry-pick` applies specific commit(s) | ‚úÖ True | `git cherry-pick` allows you to apply changes from a specific commit onto your current branch, making it a great way to selectively apply patches. |
| You can remove remotes with `git remote remove` | ‚úÖ True | `git remote remove` is used to remove a remote reference from your local Git configuration. This does not delete the remote repository itself, just your local reference to it. |
| Commits are identified by hashes | ‚úÖ True | Every commit in Git is identified by a unique SHA-1 hash. This hash is used internally to track changes and can be used to reference specific commits. |
| `HEAD` refers to your current branch | ‚úÖ True | `HEAD` refers to the currently checked-out branch or commit. It points to the most recent commit on the current branch. |
| Revert is safer than reset in shared repos | ‚úÖ True | `git revert` is safer in shared repositories because it doesn‚Äôt alter the commit history. It only creates a new commit that undoes changes, preserving the history of the repository. |
| `git stash` can hold multiple states | ‚úÖ True | Git can stash multiple changes, and each stash is indexed in the stash list. You can apply, pop, or drop individual stashes as needed. |
| You can tag commits after pushing them | ‚úÖ True | Tags can be added to commits even after they have been pushed. You just need to push the tags using `git push --tags` to make them available remotely. |
| A fast-forward merge doesn‚Äôt create a new commit | ‚úÖ True | In a fast-forward merge, no new commit is created. Git simply moves the branch pointer forward to the latest commit of the merged branch, as no divergent history exists. |
| Tags are transferred with `git push --tags` | ‚úÖ True | Tags are not pushed by default with `git push`; however, you can transfer them explicitly using `git push --tags`. |
| `git init` can be undone with `.git` removal | ‚úÖ True | Deleting the `.git` folder effectively uninitializes a repository, removing all Git tracking and history from that directory. |
| Detached HEAD means you're not on a branch | ‚úÖ True | When in a detached HEAD state, you are not on any branch. HEAD points to a specific commit instead of a branch reference. |
| `git log --oneline` shows compact history | ‚úÖ True | `git log --oneline` displays a simplified version of the commit history, showing each commit on a single line, often with just the commit hash and message. |
| Merge is preferred over rebase for shared branches | ‚úÖ True | For shared branches, merge is preferred because it maintains the commit history, while rebase rewrites history, which can be problematic in shared environments. |
| You can squash commits with rebase | ‚úÖ True | The `git rebase -i` command allows you to squash multiple commits into one, which helps in cleaning up commit history before pushing to a shared branch. |
| `git fetch` updates your local branch with remote changes | ‚ùå False | `git fetch` only updates your local copy of the remote repository. It does not affect your current branch until you merge or rebase the changes. |
| `git pull` automatically creates a new commit | ‚ùå False | `git pull` does not always create a new commit. If a fast-forward merge happens, it doesn‚Äôt create a new commit. |
| `git reset --soft` undoes all changes | ‚ùå False | `git reset --soft` only moves the HEAD and does not modify the working directory or the staging area It keeps your changes in the staging area for you to recommit. |
| You cannot merge without pushing first | ‚ùå False | Merging is a local operation and does not require pushing changes to the remote repository. Pushing is a separate operation that uploads commits after they‚Äôve been merged. |
| You must always fetch before merging | ‚ùå False | While it's good practice to fetch before merging, it‚Äôs not mandatory. You can merge directly from the remote using `git pull`, which combines both fetch and merge. |
| `git merge --abort` can undo any merge | ‚ùå False | `git merge --abort` only works if a merge conflict occurs during the merge process. It will not work after the merge is completed or if no merge conflict arises. |
| A branch is deleted when you remove it locally | ‚ùå False | Removing a local branch does not affect the remote branch unless explicitly deleted using `git push origin --delete <branch>`. |
| `git reset --hard HEAD~1` affects staged changes | ‚ùå False | `git reset --hard` not only resets the commit history but also resets the working directory and the staging area. It will discard changes permanently. |
| You can only have one stash at a time | ‚ùå False | You can have multiple stashes. Git maintains a stash stack, and you can list, apply, or pop any specific stash. |
| You can only rebase on local branches | ‚ùå False | While rebasing is often done locally, you can rebase remote branches as well, as long as you're careful not to disrupt others' work in shared branches. |
