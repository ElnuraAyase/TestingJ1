## Question & Answer

| # | Question | Answer |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | What is REST Assured? | REST Assured is a Java library for testing REST APIs using a domain-specific language. |
| 2 | How do you send a GET request in REST Assured? | Use `.when().get("/endpoint")` following `.given()` setup. |

| 4 | What is a ResponseSpecification? | An interface used to define expected response status, headers, and body content. |
| 5 | What is baseURI used for? | Sets the root URL for all requests to reduce repetition. |
| 6 | How do you authenticate with a token in REST Assured? | Use `.header("Authorization", "Bearer your_token")`. |
| 7 | What does the `then()` method do? | It defines validations/assertions in REST Assured. |
| 8 | What is the purpose of Hamcrest in testing? | Provides matchers for creating readable assertions. |
| 9 | What status code means resource not found? | 404 Not Found. |
| 10 | What status code confirms success? | 200 OK. |
| 11 | Which method is used to send data to the server? | POST. |
| 12 | What is JSON used for? | Data format for sending and receiving API data. |
| 13 | What does PUT method do? | Updates a resource fully. |
| 14 | What is the purpose of Swagger? | Provides interactive API documentation and testing interface. |
| 15 | What is Docker used for? | Running isolated environments for testing. |
| 16 | What tool can you use to automate testing pipelines? | Jenkins or any CI/CD platform. |
| 17 | How do you define headers in a request? | `.header("key", "value")` inside `.given()` block. |
| 18 | What is a 500 status code? | Internal Server Error. |
| 19 | What is the PATCH method used for? | Partially updating a resource. |

| 23 | Is REST Assured only for Java? | Primarily Java, but can integrate with Kotlin, Groovy, etc. |
| 24 | What is an API? | Application Programming Interface, enables apps to communicate. |
| 25 | Can you test negative scenarios in REST Assured? | Yes, using incorrect inputs and asserting expected errors. |
| 26 | How is logging enabled in REST Assured? | Using `.log().all()` inside request or response. |
| 27 | What is the HEAD method used for? | Retrieves headers without body. |
| 28 | What tool helps define reusable specifications? | RequestSpecBuilder / ResponseSpecBuilder. |

## True/False Practice

<details><summary>1. REST Assured supports only the GET and POST methods. ‚úÖ/‚ùå</summary>
‚ùå False. REST Assured supports all HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, and HEAD.
</details>

<details><summary>2. You can chain methods in REST Assured for cleaner syntax. ‚úÖ/‚ùå</summary>
‚úÖ True. Method chaining is a key feature in REST Assured for readable, fluid code.
</details>

<details><summary>3. RequestSpecification is used for checking response codes. ‚úÖ/‚ùå</summary>
‚ùå False. RequestSpecification is used to define requests, while ResponseSpecification is for expected responses.
</details>

<details><summary>4. JSON is not compatible with REST Assured. ‚úÖ/‚ùå</summary>
‚ùå False. JSON is fully supported and commonly used.
</details>

<details><summary>5. A 200 status code means the request was successful. ‚úÖ/‚ùå</summary>
‚úÖ True.
</details>

<details><summary>6. Swagger is used only in development, not in testing. ‚úÖ/‚ùå</summary>
‚ùå False. Swagger is used for testing too.
</details>

<details><summary>7. Hamcrest provides validation matchers. ‚úÖ/‚ùå</summary>
‚úÖ True.
</details>

<details><summary>8. The DELETE method is used to create new resources. ‚úÖ/‚ùå</summary>
‚ùå False. DELETE removes resources.
</details>

<details><summary>9. Postman and REST Assured serve the same purpose. ‚úÖ/‚ùå</summary>
‚ùå False. Postman is for manual testing; REST Assured is for automated testing.
</details>

<details><summary>10. The `given()` method initializes a request. ‚úÖ/‚ùå</summary>
‚úÖ True.
</details>

<details><summary>11. Docker is unnecessary for testing environments. ‚úÖ/‚ùå</summary>
‚ùå False. Docker helps create isolated environments.
</details>

<details><summary>12. PATCH updates a resource completely. ‚úÖ/‚ùå</summary>
‚ùå False. PATCH is for partial updates; PUT is for full updates.
</details>

<details><summary>13. CI/CD helps manual testing only. ‚úÖ/‚ùå</summary>
‚ùå False. CI/CD automates builds and testing.
</details>

<details><summary>14. 500 means the request was successful. ‚úÖ/‚ùå</summary>
‚ùå False. 500 means internal server error.
